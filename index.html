<p>Terrance Stanley "Terry" Fox was born July 28, 1958. In 1980 he ran with one leg having been amputated, he started his run across canada (Marathon Of Hope) to raise money and awareness for cancer research. His cancer eventually forced him to end his run at 143 days and 5,373 Km and he died June 28, 1981. His efforts resulted in a lasting, worldwide legacy. The annual Terry Fox Run, first held in 1981, has grown to involve millions of participants in over 60 countries and is now the world's largest one-day fundraiser for cancer research; over $6 000 000 has been raised in his name. Terry  was a distance runner and basketball player for his Port Coquitlam, British Columbia, high school and Simon Fraser University. His right leg was amputated in 1977 after he was diagnosed with osteosarcoma, though he continued to run using an artificial leg. He also played wheelchair basketball in Vancouver, winning 3 national championships.</p>
