Terrance Stanley (Terry) Fox was born July 28, 1958. In 1980 he ran with one leg amputated, he started his run across Canada called "Marathon of Hope" to raise money and awareness for the research of cancer. His cancer eventually spread to his lungs so that forced him to end his run at 143 days and 5,373 Km right before he arrived at Thunder Bay. Terry Fox died June 28, 1981. His efforts resulted in a lasting, worldwide legacy. The annual Terry Fox Run, first held in 1981, has grown to include millions of participants in over 60 countries and is now the world's largest one-day fundraiser for cancer research; over $6 000 000 has been raised in his name. Terry was a distance runner and basketball player for his Port Coquitlam, British Columbia. He hoped to raise one dollar from each of Canada's 24 million people. </p>
